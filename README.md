<p> As time goes by, some things become outdated and are no longer able to fit the modern standards of the word. This also applies to a digital world that is changing every minute. For example, new technologies, approaches, trends, and tools appear to help designers and developers improve their works and ease the creation process. That’s why some digital products, such as web or mobile applications, can easily “get old” one day as well as their user interface design. The best solution is to make a website’s/mobile app redesign or create a new one, as a last resort. As an example I always like websites which are attractive and decent as viewer's perspective like Apple which is one of the biggest company of the world has stole my heart because the contrast used by them in each application like appstore is one of best sorted app i have ever use which has no words its unbelievable and the X-factor of this website is that, it is convenient for lower to higher iphones. But, if I talk about an app which has a poor interface then I guess its whatsapp for me because as we know their new policy, they are sharing our data with facebook which means our important messages are no more end to end encrypted. Apart from privacy policy it was really great and also convenient having easy features which can use by all age person. </p>

<p> Well, usability is a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a product or design to achieve a defined goal effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily.And intuitive design is used informally to describe designs that are easy to use. So, when a user is able to understand and use a design immediately—that is, without consciously thinking about how to do it—we describe the design as “intuitive”. There are some elements for usability are checkboxes, icons, notifications and more like this intuitive elements are feedback, efficiency, forgiveness and many more. </p>

<p> I always like to explore new applications in my phone but here I would like to talk about one of my favorite application which is discord. I use this app to share images, GIFs, videos, and files and the most favorite thing about discord is that it is best for the communication in games and also for streaming.
Whenever you open the app at the bottom there are five things you can see like server feeds, friends list, search option, mention bar and your profile.
In server feed it will show about the server you have joined and ping you if there is any update, In mention bar they will show you if anyone has mentioned you then it will be shown in that part.
This application is quite complex but if you get to know how to use it then mind my words you are gonna love this app.</p>

<p> While going through the book there was pretty much information about clicking and touching. In discord there is a lot of content to observe and use. I mean its a chatting app but according to me there a lot more into it. The interface of this app is bit complex but very useful if you get it.
The clicking buttons on the screen can performs many activities like you can add your friends, you can mention them in any gaming event or streaming thing, you can search anything like servers,friends,chats,memes,announcement and more by just just clicking on search.
Like this there is also a swipe feature in it where if you swipe left you can able to see your joined servers. There are different types of servers like gaming, college study or sportsclub which show specific notification while swiping left. If you swife right it will show your friends who are online so you can communicate with them by video call or just call. </p>

<p>
 Chosen App: google maps
 Despite of having Iphone I use google maps whenever I have to go at unknown places.
 I have go through this app so much deeply that's why I'm familiar with it. All activities can run by just opening navigation menu. The app displays the user's progress along the route and issues instructions for each turn. Infact there is no hierarchy used in navigation because it is freely handled through this menu.
