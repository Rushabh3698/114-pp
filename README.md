<p> As time goes by, some things become outdated and are no longer able to fit the modern standards of the word. This also applies to a digital world that is changing every minute. For example, new technologies, approaches, trends, and tools appear to help designers and developers improve their works and ease the creation process. That’s why some digital products, such as web or mobile applications, can easily “get old” one day as well as their user interface design. The best solution is to make a website’s/mobile app redesign or create a new one, as a last resort. As an example I always like websites which are attractive and decent as viewer's perspective like Apple which is one of the biggest company of the world has stole my heart because the contrast used by them has no words its unbelievable and the X-factor of this website is that, it is convenient for all types of mobile phone whether it is low or high graphics. But, if I talk about an app which has a poor interface then I guess its whatsapp for me because as we know their new policy, they are sharing our data with facebook which means our important messages are no more end to end encrypted. Apart from privacy policy it was really great and also convenient having easy features which can use by all age person. </p>

<p> Well, usability is a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a product or design to achieve a defined goal effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily.And intuitive design is used informally to describe designs that are easy to use. So, when a user is able to understand and use a design immediately—that is, without consciously thinking about how to do it—we describe the design as “intuitive”. There are some elements for usability are checkboxes, icons, notifications and more like this intuitive elements are feedback, efficiency, forgiveness and many more. </p>
